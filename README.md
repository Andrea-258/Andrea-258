# About me

**Andrea-258/Andrea-258** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- I’m currently working on applied research projects, focused on graph computational modeling using Python and NetworkX.

- I’m currently learning Python for data analysis, applied mathematics, and graph modeling , with a focus on optimization and real-world applications.

- I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis, graph theory, and mathematical modeling projects, especially in scientific, engineering, or business-related contexts.

- I’m looking for help with improving modeling methodologies, especially graph-based approaches, and optimizing computational models.

- Ask me about Python, applied mathematics, data analysis, and graph modeling.

- Fun fact: I enjoy using graph theory and programming to model complex systems and solve real-world problems, from networks to optimization challenges.
